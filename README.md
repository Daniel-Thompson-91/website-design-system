# Codecademy project: Website Design System

## What is it for?
The goal of this project was to use what I've learned about web design consistency practices and create a design theme page.

The page consists of:
- a color theme
- a list of fonts to be used (with examples of how that font looks normal, bold, and italic)
- standard font weight, font size, and font family for various HTML elements.

All feedback is welcome. I am on a learning journey, and I will never get to a place where there is nothing left to learn.
